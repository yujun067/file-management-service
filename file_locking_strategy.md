##  File Locking Strategy Overview

I’m currently using a combination of **`ReentrantLock + Caffeine Cache`** for **file-level locking**.

-  **Simple** to implement  
- ️ **Performant under moderate concurrent load**  
-  Each file is guarded by a **lock that expires automatically** if unused, helps with **memory cleanup** without manual intervention

### 1. **Async Queue + Background Writer**
- Best for **high-frequency writes**
- Supports **batching** and **I/O rate-limiting**
- Tradeoff: **High throughput** vs. **increased complexity** (thread management + monitoring)

### 2. **AsynchronousFileChannel**
- Enables **non-blocking writes**
- More suited to **low-level networking systems**
- Less ideal for **application-layer logic**

### 3. **StampedLock**
- Great for **read-heavy scenarios**
- Supports **optimistic/shared reads** to reduce contention
- **Not reentrant**  
- Offers **no advantage in write-heavy workloads** like mine

## Why ReentrantLock + Cache Works *Now*

Given the current system constraints:

- **Single-node setup** (no cross-process file access)  
- **File writes are append-only and infrequent**  
- **Concurrency level is low**, handled well by a standard thread pool  

**Conclusion**:  
**`ReentrantLock + Cache` is sufficient** to handle the current demand without introducing **extra complexity or contention**

## Future Considerations

If I observe performance bottlenecks due to:

- **Increasing write throughput**, or  
- **More frequent I/O**

I’ll consider migrating to **`Async Queue + Background Writer`** for:

- Better **batching**
- Improved **concurrency control**

Alternatively, if the workload shifts to **read-heavy** (e.g., `Read N bytes from a file at a specific offset` becomes common):

I’d consider switching to **`StampedLock`** for its **optimistic read capabilities** and reduced read contention.
